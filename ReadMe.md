# Description
It is a repository for all of the useful resources that I have found over the past years.  

# Why?
Since I use different hard drives with different operating systems for different purposes, I sometimes have a hard time synchronizing my browser bookmarks, so I thought that synchronization would be easier if I put all the links in one place and I also made a simple HTML page with all these links. Then I set this page as my browser home page.
